# Aquatic EcoSphere System
Monitoring tool for managing optimal conditions in aquatic ecosystems through real-time sensor data, educational insights, and algorithm analysis.

**Overview:**

Aquatic EcoSphere is a Python-based system designed to help aquarium owners monitor and manage the health of their aquatic ecosystems. Using underwater sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi, the system collects key water parameters such as temperature, TDS, and turbidity levels. This data is sent to a local web server, processed in a MySQL database, and displayed through a user interface on both desktop and mobile devices. The system provides real-time notifications and educational insights to help users maintain a healthy and sustainable environment for their aquatic life.

**Features:**
- **Real-time monitoring**: Collect and display water parameters temperature, TDS, and turbidity levels.
- **Notifications**: Get alerts when critical water conditions are detected.
- **Educational insights**: Learn about the biological and chemical factors affecting aquariums.
- **Algorithm analysis**: Utilize algorithms for interpreting data and providing recommendations.
